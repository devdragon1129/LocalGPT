Below is a step‐by‐step guide to using Git on a LAN network. The process generally involves setting up a central repository (often a bare repository) on one machine, then allowing other machines on your LAN to clone, pull, and push changes to that repository. Here’s how you can get started:

---

### 1. **Install Git on All Machines**

- **Download and Install:**  
  Ensure that Git is installed on every machine that will participate. You can download it from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/) (for Windows, macOS, and Linux).

- **Verify Installation:**  
  Open a terminal or command prompt and type:
  ```bash
  git --version
  ```
  This should print the installed version.

---

### 2. **Choose a Central Machine**

- **Central Repository Host:**  
  Designate one machine on your LAN as the server. This machine will host the central (bare) repository that everyone will use.
  
- **Networking:**  
  Ensure that the central machine’s IP address or hostname is reachable by the other machines on the LAN.

---

### 3. **Set Up a Bare Repository on the Central Machine**

A bare repository is used as a central repository because it doesn’t have a working directory—it’s meant solely for collaboration.

- **Create a Directory for Your Repository:**  
  On the central machine, open a terminal and create a directory:
  ```bash
  mkdir /path/to/repositories
  cd /path/to/repositories
  ```
  
- **Initialize a Bare Repository:**  
  Replace `project.git` with your repository name:
  ```bash
  git init --bare project.git
  ```
  
- **Permissions:**  
  Make sure that the directory and repository have the appropriate permissions so that other users can access it (this might involve adjusting user groups or using shared folders).

---

### 4. **Accessing the Repository Over the LAN**

There are a few methods to share the repository on your LAN:

#### **a. Using SSH**

- **Set Up SSH:**  
  Ensure that SSH is enabled on the central machine. Users on the LAN should be able to connect to it.
  
- **Clone Using SSH:**  
  On a client machine, use:
  ```bash
  git clone username@central_machine_ip:/path/to/repositories/project.git
  ```
  Replace `username` and `central_machine_ip` with the actual username and IP address of the central machine.

#### **b. Using the File Protocol**

- **Shared Network Folder:**  
  If the repository folder is on a shared network drive, you can clone using the file URL.
  
- **Clone Using File URL:**  
  ```bash
  git clone file:///path/to/repositories/project.git
  ```
  Ensure the shared folder is mounted or accessible by the client machine.

#### **c. Using Git Daemon**

- **Set Up Git Daemon:**  
  Git includes a built-in daemon for read-only access. On the central machine, you can start the daemon:
  ```bash
  git daemon --reuseaddr --base-path=/path/to/repositories/ /path/to/repositories/project.git
  ```
  
- **Clone Using Git Protocol:**  
  On a client machine:
  ```bash
  git clone git://central_machine_ip/project.git
  ```
  Note that the Git protocol is typically read-only unless you configure push support.

---

### 5. **Working with the Repository**

Once cloned, client users can use standard Git commands:

- **Make Changes & Commit:**
  ```bash
  git add .
  git commit -m "Your commit message"
  ```
  
- **Push Changes to the Central Repository:**
  ```bash
  git push origin main
  ```
  Replace `main` with your branch name if it’s different.

- **Pulling Updates from the Central Repository:**
  ```bash
  git pull origin main
  ```

---

### 6. **Considerations for Collaboration**

- **Branch Management:**  
  Use branches to manage different features or fixes and merge them as needed.
  
- **Conflict Resolution:**  
  Collaborate by regularly pulling changes to avoid conflicts. If conflicts arise, Git will notify you, and you’ll need to merge manually.

- **Backup and Security:**  
  Regularly back up your central repository, and if needed, secure your repository using SSH keys or user account controls.

---

### 7. **Troubleshooting Tips**

- **Network Issues:**  
  Verify connectivity between machines using ping or SSH.
  
- **Permissions:**  
  If you encounter permission errors, check both the file system permissions and any SSH configurations.

- **Repository Corruption:**  
  Regularly backup and verify your repository integrity using Git’s built-in commands like `git fsck`.

By following these guidelines, you’ll have a functional Git setup on your LAN network that supports collaboration and version control. This setup can scale from a small team to a larger network of users working on shared projects. Enjoy your Git collaboration!

=============

Below is a detailed guide for hosting and using Git on a LAN network using Windows systems. This guide covers installing Git for Windows, setting up a central bare repository on a Windows machine, and configuring access for other Windows clients.

---

## 1. Installing Git for Windows

### **Download and Install**
- **Download Git:**  
  Visit [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/download/win) and download the Git for Windows installer.
- **Installation Process:**  
  Run the installer and follow the prompts. It is recommended to install the Git Bash and Git GUI components. You can generally stick with the default settings unless you need to customize your environment.
- **Verify Installation:**  
  Open **Git Bash** (or Command Prompt) and type:
  ```bash
  git --version
  ```
  You should see the installed version of Git.

### **Basic Configuration**
- **Set Your User Info:**  
  Configure your name and email globally so that your commits are properly attributed:
  ```bash
  git config --global user.name "Your Name"
  git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"
  ```

## 2. Setting Up a Central Repository on a Windows Machine

### **Designate a Host Machine**
- Choose one Windows computer on your LAN to act as the Git server. It’s a good idea to assign a static IP address or configure a reserved DHCP lease for this machine.

### **Create a Shared Folder for Git Repositories**
1. **Create a Folder:**  
   For example, create a folder named `GitRepositories` on your desired drive (e.g., `D:\GitRepositories`).
2. **Share the Folder:**  
   - Right-click the folder, select **Properties**, then go to the **Sharing** tab.
   - Click **Share…**, add the user accounts or groups from your LAN that need access, and set the permission level (read/write).
   - Alternatively, you can use **Advanced Sharing** to fine-tune permissions.

### **Initialize a Bare Repository**
A bare repository is ideal for collaboration because it does not contain a working copy.

1. **Open Git Bash:**  
   Navigate to your shared folder by typing:
   ```bash
   cd /d/GitRepositories
   ```
2. **Initialize the Repository:**  
   Create a bare repository (e.g., `project.git`):
   ```bash
   git init --bare project.git
   ```
   This command sets up the necessary Git structure without a working directory.

---

## 3. Accessing the Repository from Other Windows Machines

There are two common methods to access the central repository on your LAN.

### **A. Using the File Protocol (via Network Share)**
This method is simple and works well if your LAN environment is trusted.

1. **Map the Network Drive:**  
   - On the client machine, open **File Explorer**.
   - Right-click **This PC** and select **Map network drive…**
   - Choose a drive letter and enter the path to the shared folder (e.g., `\\CentralMachineName\GitRepositories` or `\\192.168.x.x\GitRepositories`).
2. **Clone the Repository:**  
   Open Git Bash on the client and run:
   ```bash
   git clone file:///D:/GitRepositories/project.git
   ```
   Adjust the drive letter and path according to your mapping. Note that the `file://` URL should reflect the actual drive letter as seen on the client if the network share is mapped.

### **B. Using SSH (Optional for Increased Security)**
Windows 10 and later include an optional OpenSSH server and client, which you can use for secure connections.

#### **Setting Up SSH on the Windows Host**
1. **Install the OpenSSH Server:**  
   - Open **Settings** > **Apps** > **Optional Features**.
   - Look for **OpenSSH Server**. If not installed, click **Add a feature** and install it.
2. **Start and Configure the SSH Service:**  
   - Open **Services** (search for "Services" in the Start menu) and locate **OpenSSH SSH Server**.  
   - Set its startup type to **Automatic** and start the service.
3. **Configure User Access:**  
   - Ensure that the Windows user accounts on the host have SSH public keys installed (stored in `C:\Users\username\.ssh\authorized_keys`).
   - Generate a key pair on the client (using Git Bash):
     ```bash
     ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your.email@example.com"
     ```
     Then, copy the contents of the generated `id_rsa.pub` file to the host’s `authorized_keys` file for the corresponding user.

#### **Cloning via SSH**
On the client machine, open Git Bash and run:
```bash
git clone username@CentralMachineIP:/d/GitRepositories/project.git
```
Replace `username` with the actual Windows user name on the host and `CentralMachineIP` with its LAN IP address.

---

## 4. Working with the Repository

### **Basic Operations**
- **Clone Repository:**  
  Use the appropriate method (file protocol or SSH) to clone the central repository.
- **Make Changes and Commit:**
  ```bash
  git add .
  git commit -m "Your commit message"
  ```
- **Push Changes to the Central Repository:**
  ```bash
  git push origin main
  ```
  Replace `main` with your branch name if needed.
- **Pull Updates from the Central Repository:**
  ```bash
  git pull origin main
  ```

### **Collaboration Tips**
- **Branching:**  
  Create feature branches for isolated development:
  ```bash
  git checkout -b feature/branch-name
  ```
- **Merging and Conflict Resolution:**  
  Regularly pull changes to reduce merge conflicts. If conflicts occur, edit the files to resolve issues and commit the changes.

---

## 5. Additional Windows Considerations

### **Environment Variables**
- Windows Git installations may require PATH updates. The Git installer usually configures this, but verify that `git` is recognized in Command Prompt or PowerShell.

### **Using Git GUI Tools**
- **Git GUI & Git Extensions:**  
  Windows users can benefit from graphical interfaces such as Git GUI (included with Git for Windows), Sourcetree, or GitKraken, which simplify repository management.

### **Troubleshooting Tips**
- **Network Issues:**  
  Verify connectivity with **ping** or by accessing the shared folder via File Explorer.
- **Permissions:**  
  Double-check Windows share permissions and NTFS permissions on the host.
- **SSH Problems:**  
  Use `ssh -v username@CentralMachineIP` in Git Bash to diagnose SSH connection issues if you encounter problems when cloning via SSH.
